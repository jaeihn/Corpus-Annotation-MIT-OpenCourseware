{"syllabus": "Course Meeting Times Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session Description This course presents the fundamentals of object-oriented software design and development, computational methods and sensing for engineering, and scientific and managerial applications. It cover topics, including design of classes, inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors, and data structures. Students use Java\u2122 programming language to complete weekly software assignments. Class Format All lectures are active learning sessions with lab exercises. Please bring your laptop computer to every class, and remember to sit in alternating rows. If you can\u2019t attend a lecture you must still do and hand in the active learning exercises by 7pm on the day of lecture. Active learning exercises are posted a week before lecture if you need to work on them early. Lecture notes and Java\u2122 files for each class are posted two or more days ahead of time. Please download the Java\u2122 files to your laptop before class. Solutions to lecture exercises and solution Java\u2122 files are posted about three hours after lecture on the same day. Each student will be assigned to a recitation section that will be held each week. Sections have up to 12 students. Attendance is mandatory. Please bring your laptop to your recitation section. Prerequisites 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus). We use calculus in class and homework. Registration Requirements If you are a graduate student, you must register for 1.001 or 1.002 instead of 1.00. 1.001 is a 9 unit \u201cG\u201d subject. If you are a grad student and need 12 units, you may register for 1.002. Undergrads must register for 1.00; you cannot register for 1.001/1.002. You must add 1.00 to your registration in time to submit homework 1. Adds after that date are for exceptional circumstances only. Texts Recommended Horstmann, Cay. Big Java. 4th ed. Wiley, 2009.

It\u2019s also on reserve at Barker and available online. Laptop Computers Laptop computers are required for class participation in 1.00, in all lecture/lab and recitation sessions. Please use your own laptop if you own one; you must download Java (J2SE), Javadoc and the Eclipse interactive development environment (IDE); see the Tools section for directions. A laptop with at least 1 GB of memory running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OSX or Linux is needed to run the 1.00 software. A limited number of loaner laptop computers are available; please contact IS&T to request one. You may also share a laptop if necessary. Grading Policy Graded problem sets and quizzes will be returned in recitation about 10 days after they are submitted. Problem set grades, quiz and final exam grades will be available through class site gradebook. The \u2019late penalties\u2019 will not be reflected in the posted grades, but will be deducted from your total grade at the end of the term. ACTIVITIES PERCENTAGES 10 Problem Sets (each worth 4 points) 40% 30 Active Learning Exercise Sessions (each worth 1/3 of a point) 10% 2 In-class Quizzes (open book, open notes) (each worth 12 points) 24% Final Exam during Finals Period (open book, open notes) (worth 20 points) 20% Weekly Recitations, Graded on Attendance and Participation 6% Academic Honesty All 1.00/1.001/1.002 students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in their work. Your conduct in 1.00/1.001/1.002 and more generally at MIT establishes habits of professional honesty that are likely to remain with you throughout your career. 1.00 problem sets are individual assignments, not team projects. What you turn in must be your own work. Rules for 1.00 problem sets are: 1. You may work with other students in understanding the homework problem statement, and reviewing the lecture notes, readings and recitation notes. 2. You may ask each other for assistance on questions of Java syntax and language features, but not on the program logic to answer homework questions. If discussions of syntax and language features involve examples, the examples must be different than the homework problem. 3. You must write the Java program code on your own for each assignment. You are not allowed to look at other students\u2019 solutions, or show your solutions to other students. Sharing code fragments or viewing or copying each other\u2019s code is a violation of the academic honesty policy. 4. If you need help to debug your program, obtain assistance from a TA during office hours. If you are working on the homework after office hours, you are allowed to ask other students for assistance in debugging your program. However, their assistance must be limited to determining what is wrong with your program. They may not correct or rewrite sections of it for you. 5. You may copy and modify programs given in lecture or recitation notes or used in lecture or recitation by the instructors or TAs. You may also copy and modify programs from the text used in this subject. Rules for 1.00 active learning exercises are: 1. If you do the exercises in class, you may work together, up to three people. Each person in the group may turn in the same solutions if they worked together. 2. If you do the exercises outside of class, you must do them individually. You may get help from other students as in homework sets, but what you turn in must be your own work. Any student that violates these guidelines may, at the discretion of the instructor-in-charge, receive an F as their final grade in 1.00/1.001/1.002. The 1.00 staff will also bring ethical violations to the attention of MIT authorities for appropriate disciplinary action. Extension Policy for Problem Sets Problem sets are due Friday at noon; they are submitted electronically on the course Web site. You will receive one penalty-free extension until the following Monday noon per semester. No extensions beyond that, except for medical or family emergencies, which generally require a note from the dean. See the instructor if this occurs. Late homework submitted after Friday noon and before Monday noon, beyond the one free extension, is penalized 30 points. Homework submitted after Monday noon receives no credit, since solutions are posted then. If Monday is a holiday, the late deadline is the next day classes are held. Homework and Active Learning Exercise Submission If you hand in .class files (compiled code, not human readable) instead of .java files (source code, human readable), you will receive no credit. No exceptions. Double check what you hand in. If your submission is empty, even though you\u2019re sure you submitted it, you will receive no credit. No exceptions. Makeup Quiz Policy You must request a makeup quiz at least two weeks before the quiz date, unless there is a medical or family emergency that arises after that. Email the head TA if you need a makeup quiz. Valid reasons include MIT-related travel and intercollegiate athletics. Schedule job and school interviews to avoid quiz dates; there are only two quizzes in 1.00 and you must be here for them. We do not automatically schedule makeup quizzes; if no one has requested one two weeks ahead of time, none will be offered (other than for medical or family emergency).

It is as much a modeling class as a software class, and it focuses on formulating and solving engineering problems that involve computation. It considers the computer a part of an overall engineering system, and it blends the study of computation with its use in engineering settings. 1.00 incorporates active learning, through the frequent inclusion of short laboratory exercises, to allow students to self-test their understanding of the material. The homework assignments are longer exercises, in which students learn how to design and implement solutions to larger problems; most assignments have multiple correct approaches, and students are expected to identify and contrast them. Course Outcomes Course Goals for Students Apply knowledge of concepts in computing to solve real problems. Understand principles of object-oriented software modeling and development, in which physical (or logical) things are modeled as software classes and objects (things) that have behaviors (methods) and data that characterize them. Learn about basic control structures and data types, methods and recursion, classes and objects, inheritance, graphics and event processing, numberical methods, sensors, threads/multiprocessing and data structures. Gain working knowledge of an object-oriented programming language (Java) by using its features to solve engineering problems. Model engineering problems in a computation framework. Possibilities for Further Study/Careers Most students take 1.00 as an elective to provide them with skills in computation. They tend to be engineering, science or management majors who will use these skills in future laboratory, project, and design courses, and often in theses or research projects. Instructor Interview \"It\u2019s such a blast to teach [this course].\" \u2014DR. GEORGE KOCUR Below, Dr. George Kocur describes various aspects of how he taught 1.00 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving. Teaching computer science to students with diverse backgrounds We\u2019re teaching computation to students who are not computer science majors, but want and need to use computation in their engineering, science or management studies. We are not as formal as a computer science class might be, and we focus on intuition and explaining the reasons why computation is done a certain way, and how to model problems to be able to use computation effectively. Active Learning Dr. Steve Lerman, Dr. Jud Harward and Dr. George Kocur wrote grant proposals to receive funding to develop the active learning materials and to provide loaner laptops about 10 years ago. We also rewrote all the course materials to switch to active learning and co-taught this subject every semester. While the educational literature suggested active learning at the time we chose to adopt it (see McCray, DeHaan & Shuck [2003]), examples of active learning were very limited. We needed to learn, by trial and error, how to create this interactive style of teaching. We expanded the length of lectures (active learning) from one hour to one and a half hours, and we reduced the amount of material covered somewhat. Student performance increased substantially. Refining Teaching All the materials for the semester are completed before the first class: lectures, recitations, quizzes/exams, problem sets, etc. Class sessions are refined after every lecture; we jot down anything that wasn\u2019t clear to students and fix it for the next semester. Since the instructors circulate and answer questions during active learning, we get a lot of feedback on what is and isn\u2019t clear. 1.00 is famous for office hours. The TAs hold the office hours in a classroom, and they are heavily attended by students who use them for help in completing the homework, and for explanations of course materials. Curriculum Information Prerequisites 18.01 Single Variable Calculus Requirements Satisfied Undergraduate: Required for 15-1, 16, 16-ENG Restricted elective for 12 Optional for 1, 3, 3-C, 10-ENG Restricted Electives in Science and Technology Graduate: Graduate credit is available by registering for 1.001 (9 units) or 1.002 (12 units). Offered Every semester Assessment The students\u2019 grades were based on the following activities: 40% - 10 Problem sets 10% - 30 Active learning exercise sessions 24% - 2 In-class quizzes; open book, open notes 20% - Final exam during finals period; open book, open notes 6% - Weekly recitations; graded on attendance and participation Instructor Insights on Assessment We saw a major change in student outcomes after implementing active learning. Before active learning, about 15% of students had end-of-term grade averages less than 50%. After active learning, we have essentially no one below 50% or, in most semesters, 60%. Attendance is high, and quiz and exam scores have improved. An early evaluation is at Barak, M., J. Harward, G. Kocur, et al. \u201cTransforming an Introductory Programming Course: From Lectures to Active Learning via Wireless Laptops,\u201d Journal of Science Education and Technology, Volume 16, No. 4, August 2007. Student Information Enrollment 125 Students Breakdown by Year Roughly 90% undergrads and 10% graduate students. Breakdown by Major A mix of students from several different majors, including Civil and Environmental Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Management. Typical Student Background The course is an initial subject in computing; it assumes a knowledge of basic calculus and physics for some topics. No prior software experience is assumed; 75% of students have no prior experience. How Student Time Was Spent During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows: Lecture Met 3 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 37 sessions in total; mandatory attendance. Active Learning format; Students had laptop computers and sensor kits. Lectures were broken into segments; students did active learning exercises at several points in each lecture. Instructor and TAs circulated to help. Active learning was mandatory; if a student missed a class, he or she submitted the active learning component, which is posted a week ahead. Recitation Met once a week; taught by a TA; 12 sessions in total; mandatory attendance. Also in active learning format. Sections had about 10 students. Out of Class Read the assigned readings. Completed the problem sets. Worked on active learning exercises. Studied for quizzes and exams. Many students attended optional office hours, during which TAs helped them with homework and provided explanations of course content.", "readings": "Textbooks Recommended Text: Horstmann, Cay.
